# Land-Record-System
Blockchain Land Record Management System

This project is a Blockchain-based Land Record Management System developed as part of my 5th semester Blockchain course. The main goal of this project is to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for managing land/property records using blockchain technology.

The system allows users to register properties on the blockchain, list properties for sale, and buy properties through a decentralized application (DApp). Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and trust. The project integrates MetaMask for wallet-based authentication and transaction signing, enabling users to interact with smart contracts directly from the web interface.

The backend logic is implemented using Solidity smart contracts, while the frontend provides an easy-to-use interface to view properties, register new land records, and perform ownership transfers. By eliminating manual paperwork and centralized control, this system demonstrates how blockchain can improve land record security, ownership verification, and fraud prevention.
